# 32Blit Boilerplate

This is a basic template for starting 32blit projects. It shows the basic
code layout and asset pipeline, hopefully giving folk a starting point for
any new projects.

It's based on the original `template` project from the 
[32Blit Beta](https://github.com/pimoroni/32blit-beta), with added asset
handling, and some tidying up to fit in with how I do things.

## Usage

[Use this template](https://github.com/ahnlak-blit32/32blit-boilerplate/generate) to
generate your own project.

Edit the CMakeList.txt file to:

* point to the directory containing 32blit.cmake
* set the name of your project

You should then be able to follow the usual build instructions.
